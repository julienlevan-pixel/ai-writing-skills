# CIHR Grant Writing Appendices

## APPENDIX A: CIHR-Specific Language and Formatting Tips

1. **Use CIHR vocabulary:** "nominated principal applicant" (not "PI"), "principal applicant" (not "co-PI"), "co-applicant" (not "co-investigator"), "collaborator" (not "consultant")
2. **Sex and gender:** Always separate sex (biological) from gender (social construct); use CIHR SGBA+ framework
3. **Patient engagement:** Use "patient partner" not "patient representative"; reference CIHR Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR)
4. **Knowledge translation:** This is CIHR's preferred term over "dissemination" or "implementation"
5. **Indigenous health:** If relevant, reference CIHR Institute of Indigenous Peoples' Health guidelines; use respectful terminology (First Nations, Inuit, Metis Peoples)
6. **Formatting:** Use numbered subsections (1.1, 1.2, etc.); bold/underline key statements; use bullet points for criteria; include figures/tables where possible
7. **Page limits:** Respect CIHR page limits strictly. The research proposal is typically limited to 13 pages for a Project Grant.
8. **References:** Use numbered Vancouver style; cite Canadian data prominently; cite your own team's work

## APPENDIX B: Adapting This Template by Study Type

### For Randomized Controlled Trials (PANTHEON model)
- Section 1.3 emphasizes clinical equipoise and treatment gap
- Section 2 uses full trial design subsections (2.1-2.19)
- DSMB is mandatory
- Pilot vs. phase III distinction is critical for objective hierarchy

### For AI/Technology Development Studies (CardioAgent model)
- Section 1.3 emphasizes diagnostic error rates and technology limitations
- Section 2 organizes around Aims (Aim 1: Technical Validation, Aim 2: Clinical Validation, Aim 3: Prospective Evaluation)
- Include a "Pilot Data" section with performance tables (F1, AUROC, sensitivity)
- Address privacy, on-premises deployment, and regulatory pathway (SaMD)
- Include fairness/bias monitoring framework

### For Observational Studies
- Section 1.3 emphasizes knowledge gap from existing observational data limitations
- Section 2 focuses on cohort definition, exposure/outcome definitions, confounding control
- No DSMB required; describe data governance instead
- Address causal inference limitations explicitly

### For Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
- Section 1.3 emphasizes inconsistency in existing evidence
- Section 2 describes search strategy, inclusion/exclusion for studies, risk of bias assessment, synthesis methods
- Register protocol with PROSPERO
- Follow PRISMA guidelines

## APPENDIX C: Common Reviewer Critiques and How to Preempt Them

| Common Critique | How to Preempt |
|----------------|----------------|
| "The sample size is inadequate" | For pilot: explicitly state sample size calculation is not applicable and explain why. For confirmatory: provide sensitivity analyses. |
| "The team lacks expertise in X" | Ensure all key expertise areas are covered in Section 3.2; add co-applicants if gaps exist |
| "Sex and gender analysis is superficial" | Integrate SGBA+ at every objective level; collect sex AND gender separately; address non-traditional risk factors |
| "Patient engagement is tokenistic" | Name the patient partner; describe their specific contributions; reference CEPPP or SPOR framework |
| "The comparator is not justified" | Cite guidelines and evidence for comparator choice; acknowledge evidence gaps in comparator arm |
| "Clinical outcomes are not adjudicated" | For pilot: state explicitly that adjudication is not needed and justify. For confirmatory: describe full adjudication plan with central reader model |
| "The study is not feasible" | Provide evidence for recruitment rate; cite similar studies' recruitment; list site capacities |
| "Unclear how results will be used" | State the explicit pipeline: pilot -> phase III -> guidelines; name the guideline body |
| "Relying on AI to evaluate AI is risky" | Describe human adjudication with central reader model; specify sample size for adjudication; use subspecialty core labs |
| "The proposal lacks innovation" | Distinguish from prior work clearly; state what is novel about the approach, population, or endpoint |
