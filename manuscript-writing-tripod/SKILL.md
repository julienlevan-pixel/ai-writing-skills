# How to Write an AI Paper (TRIPOD-AI Guidelines)

Based on the TRIPOD+AI guidelines, here are bullet point guidelines for presenting AI paper results to medical students and bioengineers:

## Results Section Structure

### Participants and Data Flow (Item 20)

- Report participant flow with clear numbers at each stage (development, validation, exclusion)
- Include demographic characteristics, baseline predictors, and outcome frequencies
- Show missing data patterns and follow-up times
- Create flow diagrams for complex multi-stage studies
- Report differences across demographic subgroups (Table 1)

### Figures

**Figure 1** should always be a flow chart showing data flow.

If multiple datasets are merged, include separate branches for each dataset.

### Model Development Details (Item 21) - Methods

- Specify exact sample sizes for each analysis phase:
  - Training set size and outcome events
  - Hyperparameter tuning set size
  - Internal validation set size
  - External validation set size
- Report computational resources and training time when relevant

### Model Specification (Item 22) - Methods

- Provide complete model specifications enabling reproduction:
  - Mathematical formulas for regression models
  - Architecture details for neural networks (layers, nodes, activation functions)
  - Hyperparameter values used
  - Feature preprocessing steps
- Include code repositories or supplementary implementation details
- Specify any access restrictions or proprietary limitations

### Performance Metrics (Item 23a) - Results and Methods

- In methods: describe the metrics you will report
- In results: present these results

### Table 1. Baseline characteristics

Abbreviations: PVD = Peripheral vascular disease

### Table 2. Results on internal dataset

Abbreviations: AUROC = Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; PPV = Positive predictive value; NPV = Negative predictive value

*Threshold calculated at Youden Index

### Guidelines for Table 2

**For Regression Models (Continuous Outcomes):**
- Report discrimination metrics with 95% confidence intervals
- Comparison to clinically meaningful difference thresholds

**For Classification Models (Binary/Categorical Outcomes):**
- Report discrimination metrics with 95% confidence intervals
- IN ALL CASES: include calibration metrics

### Subgroup Analysis (Item 23a) - Table 3

- Stratify performance by key demographic groups:
  - Age categories
  - Sex/gender
  - Race/ethnicity
  - Socioeconomic status
  - Disease severity levels
- Test for statistical interactions between subgroups
- Address fairness implications of differential performance

### Heterogeneity Assessment (Item 23b) - IF APPLICABLE (Table 4 or Supplement)

- Report between-center/dataset variability when applicable
- Use forest plots to visualize performance across sites
- Calculate I² statistics for heterogeneity quantification
- Discuss clinical implications of performance variation

### Model Updating Results (Item 24) - IF APPLICABLE (Table 4 or Supplement)

- Document any recalibration procedures performed
- Report before/after performance comparisons
- Specify populations or settings where updates were needed
- Include updated model parameters and performance metrics

## Presentation Best Practices

### Visual Elements

**For Regression Models:**
- Use calibration plots to show predicted vs. observed continuous values
- Include residual plots to assess model assumptions
- Create scatter plots of predicted vs. actual values with identity line
- Show distribution plots of residuals by predictor variables

**For Classification Models:**
- Use calibration plots to demonstrate agreement between predicted probabilities and observed frequencies
- Include ROC curves with confidence intervals and AUC values
- Create decision curve analysis plots for clinical utility
- Show distribution plots of predicted probabilities by outcome status
- Present confusion matrices at optimal thresholds

### Clinical Context - Discussion

**For Regression Models:**
- Interpret prediction accuracy in terms of clinical decision-making relevance
- Compare prediction intervals to clinically meaningful ranges
- Discuss practical implications of prediction uncertainty
- Address generalizability across different patient populations

**For Classification Models:**
- Interpret performance metrics in terms of clinical decision-making
- Compare results to existing clinical standards or simple scoring systems
- Discuss practical implications of false positive/negative rates
- Address cost-benefit considerations of different threshold choices

### Transparency Requirements

- Report all prespecified analyses, including negative results
- Acknowledge any post-hoc analyses performed
- Discuss limitations affecting result interpretation
- Provide sufficient detail for independent validation studies

These guidelines ensure comprehensive, transparent reporting that enables critical appraisal and potential clinical implementation of AI prediction models for both regression and classification tasks.
